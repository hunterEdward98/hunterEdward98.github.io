      I was Born in Fargo, ND, and always had a noticably large interest in
      computers. Since middle school,I've been learning how various coding
      languages work, starting with html. In high school, I took an introduction
      to Java course that convinced me to pursue programming as a career. In
      College, I participated in various clubs , such as the Cybersecurity
      Student Association, where I further developed relevant skills by
      participating in collaborative competitions such as NCL(National Cyber
      League). After two years at NDSU, I decided the traditional college route
      was not for me. I attended Emerging Digital Academy, and After completing
      their course, I am confident in my ability to adapt to a rapidly evolving
      field of web-development, and learn the modern day tools that are used,
      developing complex projects to prove my skills.
