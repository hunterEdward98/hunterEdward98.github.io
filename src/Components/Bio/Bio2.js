      Since middle school, my passion I got from swimming has transferred to
      learning how various coding languages work, starting with html in middle
      school. Then, wanting to learn more, I took a course in high school that
      gave me an understanding of the concepts of java, which was a very
      entertaining course for me. I participated in various clubs in College,
      such as the Cybersecurity Student Association and ACM (Association for
      Computing Machinery). In these clubs I further developed relevant skills,
      such as critical thinking and learning BASH, and participated in
      competitions to test my knowledge, such as ICPC(International Collegiate
      Programming Contest) and NCL(National Cyber League). I also learned the
      basics of Python and C++ in my free time during these years

        After two years at NDSU, I decided not to go back as I felt the learning
        style did not suit me, so I began to look for other opportunities to
        learn about coding, without needing to take unrelated courses.
        Eventually, one of my family members came to me with details about
        Emerging Prairie Digital Academy, where I then applied and eventually
        began to attend. After completing the course at EDA, I am confident in
        my ability to adapt to a rapidly evolving field of web-development, and
        learn the modern day tools that are used, developing complex projects to
        prove my skills.
